# DeepRL Sub-Optimality


## Install

```
conda create -n cleanrl python=3.10
conda activate cleanrl
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

Then for the MinAtar environment

```
https://github.com/Neo-X/MinAtar 
```

And for the intrinsic rewards

```
pip install git@github.com:Neo-X/rllte.git 
```
I did some edits to help with image formating and size, logging, etc.

Reinstall the cleanrl environment to fix some package versions.

For installing 
```
pip install atari-py
```

Install cmake and zlib first
```
sudo apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev
```
